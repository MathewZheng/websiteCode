                <p>We are a 10-person FTC team in San Mateo, California with an intense passion for robotics. Our team is fully student-run, meaning that the members handle the design and building aspects of the robot as well as the finances and logistics. We believe that being mentor-less allows us to have more control of our team and pushes us to work for our goals.</p>
                <p>We value simplicity and iterative design as our core design principles, aiming to have a well-tested robot before every competition.</p>
