                <h1 class="page-header" >Overview</h1>
                <p>Google was our first qualifier of the 2016-2017 FTC season, and we were excited to test out the fruition of our many hours of hard work. For 5 out of our 9 team members it was their first robotics competition as well, granting them insight into how FTC matches and competitions were run. Unfortunately, we ran into several mechanical/programming issues during the day of the competition, but the experience was still eye-opening for the newest members of our team. At the end of the day, we were excited to win 1st place Think Award, 2nd place Connect Award, 2nd place Motivate Award, 2nd place Inspire Award, and advance to NorCal Regional Championships.</p>
                <h1 class="page-header" >Strategy</h1>
                <p>Our strategy was to practice a defensive autonomous by blocking other teams from scoring, and use our intake/shooter mechanisms during teleop to shoot particles into the center vortex.</p>
