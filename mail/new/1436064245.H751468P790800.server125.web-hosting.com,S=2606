Comment: 
Hi! I know this is somewhat off topic but I was wondering 
which blog platform are you using for this website?
I'm getting fed up of Wordpress because I've had problems with 
hackers and I'm looking at options for another platform.
I would be great if you could point me in the direction of 
a good platform.
