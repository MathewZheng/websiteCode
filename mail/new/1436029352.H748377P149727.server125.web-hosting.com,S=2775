Comment: 
First off I would like to say awesome blog! I had a quick question which I'd like to ask if you do 
not mind. I was curious to know how you center yourself and clear your mind before writing.
I have had difficulty clearing my thoughts in getting my ideas out.
I do enjoy writing but it just seems like the first 
10 to 15 minutes are usually wasted just trying to figure out how to 
begin. Any suggestions or hints? Cheers!
