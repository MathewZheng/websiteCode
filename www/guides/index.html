We encourage new members to read through this guide and choose a few topics to dig deeper into. We aim for this guide to be a mere introduction to robotics and to help members figure out what they are most interested in learning about. During meetings, we aim to bring these concepts to life through brainstorming, prototyping, and building. We feel that giving our new members a head start on learning about robotics concepts will allow them to understand more of what is going on at meetings. We encourage our new members to ask questions and conduct their own research into these topics if they feel compelled to. 
                    We have split up the topics into the major components of robotics. Each major component has subcomponents. Learning about some of the subcomponents is optional, while others are highly encouraged as they are essential to FIRST robotics.
