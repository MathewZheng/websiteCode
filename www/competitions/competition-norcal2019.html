                <h1 class="page-header" >Overview</h1>
                <p>The NorCal 2019 Championship was held on March 2nd and March 3rd. Unfortunately, our robot had some sizing issues, and our two way slides were inconsistent. However, our team has been able to reflect and learn from our mistakes and hopes to improve next year! <br><br>Awards we won: <br>2nd Innovate
                </p> 
                <h1 class="page-header" >Strategy</h1>
                <p>Our 2-way slides allowed our robot to achieve a more linear path from the crater to the lander, however we had some miscommunications in time management and our intake was subpar. </p>
