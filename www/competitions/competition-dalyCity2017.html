                <h1 class="page-header" >Overview</h1>
                <p>Having already qualified for NorCal from Google, the focus of the Daly City qualifier was mostly to test out newly designed parts and components of our robot. Unfortunately we had many electrical connectivity issues during the qualifier, causing our robot to stop functioning mid-match and resulting in the loss of multiple such matches. Nevertheless, we were happy to have been nominated for 3rd place Motivate Award.</p>
                <h1 class="page-header" >Strategy</h1>
                <p>Our strategy was for the most part similar to that of <a href="competition-google.html">Google</a>, except we sought to try out our newly engineered cap ball mechanism during the endgame.</p>
